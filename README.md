## i3 Window Manager 
![i3wm image](/home/bacchimcho/Pictures/'Sun Sep 28 10:12:30 PM +07 2025')

i3wm is a tiling window manager, use it because it very lightweight(bonus: this is the reason i dont use hyprland)

so i3wm can do anything a tiling window manager can do like move around the window, change windows position, floating window 

## Neovim 
I use neovim because it very lightweight, and i can edit and code any language in one editor(all in one), so i have never used IDE like jetbrain or visual studio
